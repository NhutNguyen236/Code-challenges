# Palindrome basics

- According to Wikipedia
All numbers in base 10 (and indeed in any base) with one digit are palindromic, so there are ten decimal palindromic numbers with one digit:

{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
There are 9 palindromic numbers with two digits:

{11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}.
There are 90 palindromic numbers with three digits (Using the Rule of product: 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit):

{101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, …, 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989, 999}
There are likewise 90 palindromic numbers with four digits (again, 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit. The other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two):

{1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, …, 9009, 9119, 9229, 9339, 9449, 9559, 9669, 9779, 9889, 9999},
so there are 199 palindromic numbers below 104.

Below 105 there are 1099 palindromic numbers and for other exponents of 10n we have: 1999, 10999, 19999, 109999, 199999, 1099999, … (sequence A070199 in the OEIS). The number of palindromic numbers which have some other property are listed below:
